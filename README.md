# Housing Sensor Project

The [Urban Big Data Centre](https://ubdc.ac.uk) is conducting a study of 
indoor environmental data in Scottish houses.
We are using Raspberry Pi devices (kindly donated via https://picycle.org)
and a set of commodity sensors to measure:
* light
* temperature
* humidity
* atmospheric pressure
* CO2
* VOCs
* particulates
* ambient noise
* NOx

The sensor data is recorded in a persistent CSV file. Generally, sensor boxes
are left in people's houses for one week, then returned to the research team
for data analysis.
